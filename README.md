## HW 01 - Halloween Candy

This is an example of a README file. 

You can write in plain text here to describe what this project is about. 

You can also **bold** or *italicize* text. Try it out here!

Remember, in Exercise 9 you have to modify this README file.

My name is **Yue Jiang**, and I'm in all lab sections.

My favorite Halloween candy is *Warheads*.
